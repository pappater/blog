And they care, when the father, who was in worrisome for month, in separation with his son, doubting the son's arrival and his lives, heard the news, was waiting to witness the group, to return back home, the eye searches for his son, recognized, grab his hands, pull, and hold him on his chest, and wails and cries, and return back to their nest, to end their long lasting suffering.
