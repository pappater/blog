Already 30 sambar sadham poiduchi, nee enna nalla illangura, said by the waiter at J.R.Jana restaurant. The enquiry was made and a chaos happened and it got clear as it is of useless in spending time fighting for justice hence moved and reached Shell Select for redbull, snickers and stuff and it was about 1: 30, taking right to Chennai outer ring road with 60% of setup. Not sure about the stuff behind this but when something starts up with negative, then the whole trip is positive.

On the left of Outer ring road at Poonamallee, was the bengaluru highway. Within a KM, taking right, connects Thirumazhisai, and on continuing further for half hour, reaches
Thiruvalluvar. It is a pleasant route, though one can find some factories and other manufacturing stuff. Unexpected heat caused people to stop aside, and was cooling down to continue further. After numerous zig zags, it joined Uthukotai road, and at the Poondi was halted for the boost. On watching the drinking of redbull, an old lady inquired about the availability of water for her thirst and without second thinking it was said NO. There was a water bottle in the tank bag, which is a hydration bottle, and it is hard to give her water. But even though, if really intended, then it can be provided in any way possible. And the devil in the corner acted cruelly and said No to the lady and the way she turned her face strikes hard as she thought the water was being drunk but not provided to her for some reason. After the revelation of the devil, there came the good in us, in an instance, and made regret for the evil event that had taken place. It humiliated and made us look like an inhuman, that we had made a tremendous mistake to mankind and stuff. The good in us, will justify the bad act the devil had done and worsen the scenario. We sinned when the good was revealed and made its justification. After some thought on this, finalising the good justification, decided to give the water to the old lady, but she was gone and lost.

Poondi lake looks like a fully drunken man. The face and eyes and stuff popup out after consuming enormous amounts of drink and food, was the view of Poondi lake. People baited for fish, some caught huge, and put them on the stall outside the lake, selling it for the road passerbyers. The road is smooth and filled with greenery looking in any direction. The freshly made pots and drishti bommai, were kept under the seven shaped tree, background with paddy field and it was a look one can admire for hours.

It was a dark smoke, that was emitting from the truck, the whole truck body was decorated with all sort of decorating item available, was struggling to climb on the steep hill road, and its whole body was settled by the smoke for the opposite truck that was emitting the same dark smoke and this time it also hit on the fella, who was tailgating back with his black splendour bike, was making a disgusting face, as it was the first time, his face receives such an amount of smoke and his face layered black with all sort of dust and not able to hold all this sudden event, he closed his eye and slow downed his bike, stopped aside, rubbed his face little and took a bottle of water and poured on his face and rubbing like he made a sin as it is sticking on his face. A stray dog was passing by, and it was chased and frightened by an old man, wearing white dhoti, with his stick in a beating position, was also frightened by the dog as he was bitten by some other stray dog a couple of days back. To the left of this scene, standing tall, Vel Talkies, an old structured cinema theatre, abandoned now, was painted yellow and painted some advertisement front below the foot of Lakshmi statue that was installed at the top of the building.

Uthukottai borders TN and AP. Continuing straight, it takes to Satyavedu, a small town in Chittoor district. The road is little off and there are a lot of villages who speak both Telugu and Tamil. It was Puthupakkam, where a lady, wearing black saree and with sabarimala mala on her neck, was constantly in action with the monkey, rounding her to get the bajji and snack that she was freshly cooking to sell it for the passersby. It was the old bus stop that she turned into her snack shop. Near to it was a hut, green painted, with a Vilaku shaped spot in front to keep Vilakku, bordered with Red colour stripes. Six old men and a lady were in conversation about some event from their village. It was an intense one. Beside this, was a street, cement road, echoed by the sound that someone was dragging a stick on the road. It was a buffalo, whose neck was tied up with a big stick inorder to make her to only graze and to prevent her from running away.

People in bulk were taking the left turn to an empty ground and on witnessing it, it was a camel that was taking people for a ride. Selfies and stuff were taken and it looked unusual. To the centre of the town, was a big clock tower painted red and in the centre was placed with Gandhi statue. At a distance, there was a square shaped little temple in the centre of the road, where people worship and sabarimala devotees put their malai from there. All the stuff for the pooja were provided by the nearby shop, which is a hut, owned by an old woman, wearing yellow saree.

The beam that was a hindrance for riding in the evening darkness, was rowed by the quarry truck. Intermittently, there was a diversion road and it was a long ride to join the Kolkata highway. Kattil and chairs were presented in front, and the back was a dhaba, where the gang from North India were in preparation of roti and gravies. The drunken gang, who had no clue of what they were doing there, managed to get some food, parcelled, and stumbled and went East ward. The road now belongs to trucks as it was filled with other states and their own state lorries and stuff which is hard for the other vehicle to move. Redhills, Porur highway, Toll, Tambaram, Shell Select, Medavakkam.
