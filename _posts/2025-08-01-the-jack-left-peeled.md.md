The jack was left peeled.  
What was made to chop off the catâ€™s paw ?  
Since 1929.  
Still the florist exists?  
Still there is fear of crossing the road.  
Ladies all over the pani puri shop.  
No politics. It is simple stuff happening.  
And it was filled with tires and people in a circle.  
People show their head to the world in the evening.  
Why is there no chopstick in instant noodles ?  
The cleaner cleaned, and spit and left unclean.  
Still the pigeon is not used to the sound of a bullet.  
All the doges on the streets are found to be tagged and collared.  
The fear in crossing those dogs.  
Nose pierced.  
The same green dejavu.  
Cat and orange cat.  
Sweet basket.  
Pigeon pigeon.  
Beep beep beep.  
I counted seven moving objects.
