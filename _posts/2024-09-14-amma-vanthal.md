I was listening to the audiobook _Amma Vanthal_. Initially, I was drawn in by the narration, and soon found myself absorbed in the story. At first glance, it seems like a simple tale, but upon deeper reflection, it delves into the mindset of people and how they react to certain situations.

Appu, the protagonist, is a scholar who remains unaware of many happenings around him, yet he is rich in thought and pure in heart. The narration begins with Appu arriving at the banks of the Kaveri River and reminiscing about his admission to a scholar's school during his childhood, where Bhavani Ammal was in charge. He was accompanied by his father, Thandapani. Bhavani Ammal cared for Appu, teaching him the Vedas and other subjects. As his studies concluded, Appu found himself reflecting on his past and future. Indhu, a young widow living with Bhavani Ammal, begins to develop feelings for Appu.

When Appu decides to leave for Chennai to reconnect with his family and his mother, Alangaram, Indhu expresses her affection for him, much to Appu's shock and discomfort. Unaware of her feelings before, he becomes irritated and leaves Tiruchy for Chennai to stay with his mother.

Thandapani, a city clerk who also taught the Vedas to high-profile individuals in his spare time, was regularly visited by Sivasu, a wealthy man seeking help with his horoscope. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that Alangaram is having an affair with Sivasu. This revelation deeply affects Appu. Alangaram had once hoped that by making Appu a scholar, she could atone for her sins and seek forgiveness from him.

Later, Bhavani Ammal falls ill and writes to Appu, prompting him to return to Tiruchy to check on her health. She decides to leave her house to Indhu and entrusts the school to Appu. Despite all this, Appu chooses not to write back to his mother. One day, Alangaram visits, seeking answers as to why Appu hadn’t written to her since returning to Tiruchy. Realizing that Appu had not forgiven her, she plans a pilgrimage to Kashi to atone for her past actions.

**Thoughts**

I’ve outlined the main plot of the book above. However, when viewed from the perspective of each character, the story takes on different nuances. The narrative centers around Appu’s decision on where to settle after finishing his studies. His choice involves Indhu, who loves him deeply, and the realization that he prefers the simplicity of village life over the city. This decision is solidified when he learns of his mother’s affair.

From Indhu’s perspective, she fell in love with Appu even before her marriage. The death of her husband, though tragic, gave her a sense of hope that she could finally express her feelings to Appu.

Thandapani, despite knowing the truth about Alangaram’s affair, chose not to cause chaos or drama.

Alangaram, even after deciding to redeem herself through Appu’s education, continued her affair with Sivasu.

This story reflects the complex nature of human behavior. There is no clear distinction between good and bad; people are often compelled by societal norms to follow a protocol. In truth, every action stems from a person's heart and desires. Humans are inherently designed by nature to behave in this way. Nature bestows upon all living beings a set of instincts, but only humans have the added complexity of labeling actions as "good" or "bad." This labeling happens only after the action is completed, and over time, it can create guilt, even as the actions persist.

Most of these actions aren’t connected to conscious decision-making. While it may seem like we are in control of small choices, when viewed from a broader perspective, we simply repeat the patterns of the past and future, regardless of what the _Gita_, Bible, or Quran says.
