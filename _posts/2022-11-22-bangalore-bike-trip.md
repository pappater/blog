It was my first road trip after getting a Yamaha FZ FI. I was cruising at a maximum of 80 kmph and the mileage seems to be good. For a full tank fuel capacity of 13 Litres gave around 600 km of ride and both highway and inside the city traffic. Captured photos and recorded some events of people's talks.
