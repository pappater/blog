Why is he 
shouting like a madman ?  
Even the country is not at stake, but why is he ?   
Leaves dance through the wind and drizzle.  
And who know what the other beings are doing in this night time,  
Humans' noses point in the direction of gossip.  
Constant seek of something to happen.  
He is not a victim, but happy to see others to be.  
In this game, he gets pleasure now and then,  
But now it happened at the right time.  
The ground was flooded with voices.  
Wailing, it can be called so.  
Something that can be emitted from the soul,  
If any of his soul left the body.  
It was like that, but not like that.  
Bunch of soul with the body at the ground.  
Crowded, and watching over the soul,  
Struggling for his life.  
No, humans react much to life now a days,  
That without knowing the context,  
People assume with their fantasy,  
It was a wailing fantasy.  
It happened, and wonder what would be on  
The people's mind.  
It excites me to know them.  
One might have thought, someone was burning.  
Some thought, if his loved one, loves someone.  
Some thought, his closes passed away,  
Some thought and some thought.  
It was the outcome of an event,  
Saying the truth,  
To the crowd,  
And it led to this wailing of cry.  
His hand still holds the phone.  
Maybe he is drunk.  
His eyes are red.  
The wall reflects his body and crying.  
He shouts like a madman.  
Their people stare and watch.  
None cared but he who wailed and cried.  
It is not a pleasant stuff to watch a madman crying,  
All of sudden, who was in sane for these many days,  
And sudden madness, always triggers weird emotion,  
And that was all who was witnessing it, felt.  
All six floor folks, crowded, and watching.  
None cared, and upon realizing so, he gradually,  
Reduces his volume, and emitted some facts,  
Which is ineligible, and noisy.  
None cared, some who realised the fact,  
Moved their heads and back their room.  
For those who like me, who donâ€™t know the facts,  
Too left for their room.  
The narrow stairs feel like a step to hell for that time.  
And slowly, life settled to its normal form.  
And there comes the cleaner of the room,  
For the day, it was he who was wailing at the ground.  
Now he seems fine and gentle.  
He let out a few stuff, to put his opinion in front of the witnesses.  
And I shook my head and heard nothing.  
I understood nothing.  
I left it to be nothing.
