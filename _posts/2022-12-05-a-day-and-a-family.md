The clap echoed, their presence was showcased, and the entrance they were entering was decorated with lights and roses and people who were welcoming the other people for the event. All of sudden, their expression changes by seeing the new gang entering, by clapping their hands and hesitation for a while whether to let them inside or not. Fear made them do nothing and the gang entered into the marriage mahal with intense clapping. The transgenders, on the stage, were blessing the bride and groom, got their reward, and left without saying anything. It was their first such event, both the transgenders and the marriage event peoples. Outside, few young people were playing football and watching the transgenders on coming out, still clapping, and one of the transwomen made a wick at a block, who looked handsome, and smiled at him as if seducing him. He blushed and feared. And ran over to his home.

It was raining intermittently and the subway was protected with the blue semi circle shield, in order to conceal the rain water stagnation. The rail, which was halted for half an hour finally got its signal and it started its journey towards the west. Kollidam is showing off its cruelty and the silver beach blurting out her history of chaos and stuff. It seems that it is a normal thing to take vengeance on the next village and the village goes back to sadness if not any such stuff is executed for the opponent village. Hence is the routine for both the village to trigger the event that resulted in vengeance and stuff that hold the pride in that, and thus that is how the generation were fed with the purpose of their lives. And it was one of those events where there was wailing at the house, in front, knowing her husband was killed and melted at the sea, was crying with the neighbour holding two of her children side by side. She, sick of such an event and the silliness, moved far away from the place with her sons to the town. And she was blurting those past events to the new neighbourhood. On revealing those past sadness, a lot of emotions which were unknown to them were revealed, making them sad and inferior and struggling to mingle with the new town mates.

It was the elder son, who was on a bike, in search of coffee shop, alone and scared, was passing the head post office, and found a old little dirty shop, hesitated, cancelled the intention for having coffee, took right turn, passing the governing buildings and stuff and stopped near a stream, grazing the tharaipalam. Its wail made him sad. He sat watching its flow and remembered his past and the darkness crowded his soul as people were wailing at that time, when his father was killed and thrown into the sea. Maybe this steam will reach the same ocean and may wail to his dead father, he thought. He remembered how stunned he was when he heard the news and the strange feeling that occupied him, and how he didn’t cry a bit, but everyone, the known and unknown faces were crying and wailing for the disappearance of his father. Is he dead or eloped ? Why am I not crying ? Am I that much of a rude son ? Why can’t I act like them ? Why is no one asking me to cry ? Am I invisible ? My soul is invisible ? His baseness was making him suffer and all of the sudden the whole class people came from his school, with the teacher and stuff. When he saw them, he cried and tears dropped down and the whole school gang accompanied him without consoling him and letting his emotion drain along with the people surrounding him. He was back to present, hesitated watching this tharaipalam, and the dark past event, got up, ignited the bike and retained home.

The new town and people didn't impact him, the elder one. He didn’t feel anything post the dark phase. He wanted new alternation and focus, to make his life move one. They didn’t sleep the first day at the new town and new home. After some chaotic thought and unable to bear those emotions, scared with the thought, they slept frightened, the two sons. But the mother wanted the night to stretch long as she got the night only a lone time, with her thought, was in struggle with the past sadness and the future horror-ness, that was continuously altering in her mind, and her tears soaked the pillow. The tiredness of the body and the eye, triggering her to get rest but she was afraid to sleep. She wants the night to suffer with those horrible thoughts. It was a safe place for her to handle those thoughts.

The morning was bright and sound with the street traffic and stuff, and she hesitated on why she got up, releasing all those dark thoughts all at once, and wishing the day would pass soon, for her night, to handle the thought again. The sons were ready for school and she, for time being, was distracted with the thought and focus on the sons, feeding and the positive future of the son's life. The boys too were positive with the new day.

She winked, the lower left corner of the lip twisted and animated and the iris half shut by the eyelid, and to upgrade more of this seductiveness, few thin lines of dark black hair screened in the left part of the face and danced as it reflected how his soul conditioned. She got up from the stop, rock under the banyan tree and moved to the back side. He too got up, without winking and followed her face and she disappeared back of the tree. With intention to not to leave her face a moment, rushed, and with the intention to seek the continuation of seduction, he happened to see a big pond with lilies and lotus. His flow of thoughts got stopped and on search where she went, there she was standing behind him, and blurted out a hard laugh of cunningness and stuff and the face slowly forms into male feature of moustache and beard that wears saree, and the base voice of laughing intensified to gave him a chill moment of discussing, and she now become a trans woman. He got up from his dream, the younger son hesitated, nodded, settled, drank water and lay still on his bed and remembered the morning event with the transwoman.
