It was kind of weird for those fifteen days of time. 
A lot is relieved, and people look at it as normal stuff, yet I don’t see it like that. Are they any sack that we can cut and grab the baby out of it? The amount of blood lost during that phase is horrible. For a week, they are not allowed to eat solid food, and they look at the poop to confirm, with the bowel movement, that everything will work fine. And none have any seriousness in them. They act like an object. Yes, it hits hard when it’s for us, and even they were saying, “That’s not a big deal,” until and unless they go through that process. I don’t want that to get repeated, and hence, I’m sticking to it.  
After a long time, I was spending time listing out the tasks and working on them. It was 10 in the morning, and the task was to fix the article UI and the logic for the web scraper. I don’t want to rush and complete it for the day, and regret for the rest of the day for not using them. Instead, it should be like one or two agent tasks for the day, and even with the bug, will go for the next, and continue with the tuning. That’s the plan. And today it really came well. I fed the raw task to ChatGPT, and she tuned it in such a way that GitHub Copilot understood the statement well and gave a nice output — and it really worked. It was what I was expecting. Except for some tweaky stuff needed, that’s postponed to the next days and stuff.  
And I filled out the Zippo and burned stuff. I read long back that I don’t smoke, but I like to burn things. But even destroying non-living things hits hard. I don’t like them to burn, except for the campfire or wood kitchen. So, I was filling and flickering around the corners. She too liked to see the flicker. And the harmonica too. Kind of nice to showcase to the children, like a child. We haven’t become adults — it is always the child at the core. And the idea was that we are adults, but the truth is we are still children of Mother India. I like her, yet the people got me sick of it.  
The devils got the hit now. The classic Dostoevsky conversations were in place, and I already got hooked into it. Cashed out 3K. And she liked the cracker for 6K. I’m glad. I said the other day, I will wait for it and catch it to come for you. And I said, “That is it,” and not “That is that.” She realized and nodded. It is constant confirming of this and that, yet no one knows this and that — that this and that are already fictional ideas, and we thought this is how “this” and “that” were interpreted for us, and stuff goes on like that.  
What about the Parvatha Malai? It’s gone and dusted. Can go for a tea ride though. Let’s see. And none care. But that’s fine. READ READ READ, you idiot. And it was exactly what I thought, and he kept it on the highway. Will it help? But that’s not the point. Take bath in the morning. Kanthal aanalum kasaki kattu. The eye drop is a savior.  
I was like an oversharing soul — regret for it later — and discard the roots of other souls and suffer alone.  
The sambar is calling me there.  
And you should listen to me — this. I kind of feel like an insect, being part of the lower floor. You don’t understand. They were asking to take it up to the first floor. But I don’t want to be like that. The food should be from a single source of truth. Having it on two floors won’t give us any good. Already, they were not speaking to me. Let it be. Kind of feels like I was a third person for them. But they don’t know it is good to have a third person. We can’t get rid of them altogether. The old tradition is that they give jewels to the ladies, and the immovable assets to the gents. The parents might have thought that they would provide for them, as well as support their sisters in case of emergency. And with that, it all goes good. However, we haven’t included their son’s wife, who willingly, by default, was in chaos with the mother-in-law — no matter the scenario — and without any option, the son too was in sync with his wife, that it was everyone turned against the parent. With that, their daughters are the only savior that finds sympathy. Yet, it is not her house to take control and make decisions. If so, the wife will raise a question against them. Won’t it be planned that the opposite remains the same? If it is with the daughters with all the immovable assets, then too, the same stuff happens. It is that the son, at that moment, becomes the savior, and vice versa. The characteristics of it always change with respect to the money or any form they hold. And yet, no one talks about this root cause. Any family with this as the base will live in a chaotic environment, and some will like this, as they find this as their purpose and hence choose it wisely. For some, the purpose is different. Rather than within their family circle, it broadcasts for the public benefit — how Tamil old kings were doing for public good. So again, if you see it deeply, it is just ego that is causing all these nuisances. Ego, as it is, just compares themselves with others, in the most common factors that add metrics to them. Some of these are status, assets, pride, money, education, etc. And those who are in a closer community, who know each other very well, might get introduced to ego if the opposite party has grown in any of the factors pointed above. In such a case, the view can be of two — one is inspiration, the other is jealousy. One who is inspired will become like them, but those who don’t like to become like them — who have more pride than God — will choose jealousy. They do nothing and aim partly to let that person down. A tiny smile tweaks at the corner whenever they hear anything bad about them. They celebrate. And for the rest of the time, they feel sad for their growth and stuff. Some go beyond that and aim to disturb that growth by introducing evil doings and stuff. If the purpose of all the metrics were channeled in a well-managed way, like doing public things, jealousy would drastically reduce, as no one wants to be doing good public things. They won’t compete for the sake of others but for themselves. Such people are praised for their public good deeds, and their names have been brought up even after their death. However, bringing names for generations is another topic, which I don’t want to put here.  
And all of it is because of prejudices. No one wants to understand anything. Let the play begin and never end.
