I loved everything in this movie. Franz's acting exposed a lot that connects deeply, and the nonlinear way of capturing each decade's reflection is smoothly handled that I didn't spend time in gathering the story lines. Cinematography and the music are rightly captured and the saxophone at the end elevates the emotion that was gathered throughout the movie and it grooves with the audience as well. If at all there wasn't the last thieving scene, my heart would have weighed high and spent in sadness. I personally like viktors cozy corner and his tattoo. The dedication to differentiating the body physique  shows the effort the entire team put forward into it. And the transition among the different decades is again a good mentioning that it was smooth.  I felt the hug, cigar and a lot many scenes are so connected. I can keep on thinking about this movie for some time for sure.
