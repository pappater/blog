We evolved without killing each other, tax, and weapons.  

Whatever it may be, it is a flaw for the opposition party, and that is how people were brought up, that we have to stand for our family, group, community, village, town, city, district, state, country, party and stuff. Yet no one realises it is an earth, that we have to stand for it as well. And the ruling party, also not fair play. They have the control of all medium, that the distraction is easy, and any can be, who was decided to be president of vice president, gets the fame in a day, and elected as a leader, and made the possibility to rule the nation for decade and above, and now the strategies evolved and the mind behind is play in sync with the money, even the opposition party seeking help from these minds, and the minds have their own formula for each of its party, and why can’t this mind rule the nation if at all they have the power to make anyone to be the ruler of the nation. Reserved ? Maybe or not. But it is clear, anyone can be a leader, but they need to keep an eye on them.  

And the movie, that talks about the post and pre war scenario, the camps, the cruelty, and death, suffering, jesus and stuff, why can’t they look at the middle east, and stop the damn thing ? they want this to happen, to make a movie in the future.  

And they talk about the cities, and ignore the village that disappears. Only the opposition talks about this, and the whole nation, which is of nationalist, discards this, and takes pride in their useless stuff.  

That's not fair. The tax on people for the road, and cars they rode.  
Yet, they won’t return any, for long traffic that consumes blood and petrol.  

It burns when something is up. America burns a lot nowadays. They can’t see people living their own life, ignoring America. You can no longer be the gang leader. Soon you won’t be in the gang. You don’t have history, rightly said by the Chinese who don’t know how to smell yet he keeps smelling and acting a dog stuff. The hell with these people.  

I know this guy. I used to admire him during my childhood. He was the party head back then. Now still part of the party. But I don't like him now. He is shit.
