THE GIRL WITH THE NEEDLE
Human cruelty is more horrible than the ghost and this true event captured the essence of the post war era, and tells, for survival, humans can go any extreme. The visual is stunning with black and white with high contrast. I personally loved the sound design that when Karoline's husband first visited her, the sound captured the breath under the mask, and the BGM too hit at the right spot to elevate the essence for the screen. The screen play where karoline kisses her husband in front of everyone is something so simple yet powerful to convey a lot in a single shot. As usual, the ancient is famous for woman exploitation and that too was captured nicely. The role played for Dagmar should be highly appreciable that as she said at the court room in the end, she has to be given with the medal. Erena was also a catchy character, it is of one another who should be there for. The factory owner is a coward. Karoline's husband has become a go to place for Karoline when live out on stake. Many places were left open, unexplored, I think because this story captures the human emotion rather than the other external factors. The title is apt one that many things can be considered as a needle from the story. I would rate 4/5 for this gem.  

Some quotes:  
Karoline: I'm fine.  
Dagmar: You don't stick a needle in yourself if you're fine.  

Dagmar: The world is a horrible place. But we need to believe it's not so.
