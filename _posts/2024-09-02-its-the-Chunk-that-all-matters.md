We were having a discussion on a topic where it involves prime time.
People were so good at what they were doing and got succeeded and at some point, it reflected to the public. The public, so called common people, consume its essence, pick it up and start to work on it, to achieve the same level of success and that was their prime time. To focus on one thing, work on them, till you get fulfilled which won’t make you realise what we are really doing these many years. What I'm trying to convey is that people should admire the stuff they do, enjoy the pleasantness it gives when it is fulfilled rather than feeling about their past actions which gives them a disguise.

I was talking with my wife about this. Every human (from my point of view) has the bad thought that they feel worried about not succeeding. For them, success is not in their timeline. I was telling her that success is a chunk. One should realise it then and there in order to accomplish the passion they are taken in their hand and no matter what the consequence is all about but if a human who has figure out what he wants to do in their life itself is a successful stuff, that this one moment of realisation will keep them in sync till the end. It is a feeling of success now that long last as there is not a threshold where one can achieve and call it a success, and if one does, then it is not, according to my view.

It's September 2nd, and tomorrow is our 1st year anniversary. Looking back in these month, I got to know that how we were passionate about our things that we never let it go, that we were constantly work on them parallelly, without sacrificing it at any matter, and with this process, we learnt new stuff from each other that i feel that i’ve already succeeded in this life. And that being said, that doesn't mean that I'm gonna get rid of my passion, and look for a new one to consume the taste of success. It is always a big chunk of passion, where we are constantly working on its branch and at one point of time, the chunk looks majestic yielding fruits and shades and stuff.

I'm glad that I’m a successful person even though it was not approved by the third person who doesn't know the spelling of my first name. Why should we even care about their opinion? It is the self realisation on these matters and the passion and interest towards the big chunk is all that matters.
