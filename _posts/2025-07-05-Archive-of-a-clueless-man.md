**Archive of a clueless man.**

**It was unconscious**  
and infinite numbers of time, the tea master had twizzled and poured the tea to the glass, that arranged symmetrically, picked one at the time, dropped abruptly at the table, signalling its completeness; that was picked by a dark hand, rolled rudrakshai at the wrist and pans carefully to his mouth, sipping, and in ecstasy and blissfulness, shifted his head slightly to left and right, wears a white dash of vibhuti, centred with small red kungumam dot, and back to reality, when the television was loud enough to blurt out the crime scene from some local village. He then back to his previous thoughts of doubtfulness; where it showcased and raised a question whether his front gate of his farm at the hill side that was surrounded by tiny rocks of different form, remote it was that only the goat and local dogs roam hither and thither; filled with excess of water from december rain; and none of the human soul would know such a farm exists that the gate, that was painted blue and bordered red; was in closed condition or not. It was this thought that triggered when he reached the destination of the tea shop; and was in a condition that it was not possible to travel back thither, the farm with the front gate painted blue and bordered red; and hence isolated with his thought of doubtness alone, regretting the thoughts, and also for its occurrence that distract the blissfulness caused by the tea that was dropped abruptly by the tea master on the table. And with the political rumours being telecasted on the television, he was back to the present, and intermittently was worried with the doubtfulness, like the stone that caught inside his shoe.
