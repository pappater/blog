It was unconscious and infinite numbers of time, the tea master had twizzled and poured the tea to the glass, that arranged symmetrically, picked one at the time, dropped abruptly at the table, signalling its completeness; that was picked by a dark hand, rolled rudrakshi at the wrist and pane carefully to his mouth, sipping, and in ecstasy and blissfulness, shifted his head slightly to left and right, wears a white dash of vibhuti, centred with small red kungumam dot, came to reality, when the television was loud enough to blurt out the crime scene from some local village. He then back to his previous thoughts of doubtfulness; where it showcased and raised a question whether his front gate of his farm at the hill side that was surrounded by tiny rocks of different form, remote it was that only the goat and local dogs roam hither and thither; filled with excess of water from december rain; and none of the human soul would know such a farm exists that the gate was painted blue and bordered red; was in closed condition or not. It was this thought that triggered when he reached the destination of the tea shop; and was in a condition that it was not possible to travel back thither, the farm with the front gate painted blue and bordered red; and hence isolated with his thought of doubtness alone, regretting the thoughts, and also for its occurrence that distract the blissfulness caused by the tea that was dropped abruptly by the tea master on the table. And with the political rumours being telecasted on the television, he was back to the present, and intermittently was worried with the doubtfulness, like the thorn that caught inside his shoe.

And next to him was another man, who wear a sadness and unshaven beard of white and grey, aged 60, was staring down at the bottom left leg of the table down, making false conversation within himself, regarding some past unpleasant event that was bugging him for long, about his village at the sea shore, a tiny one, that run parallel to the canal, that the cows grazing beyond that, and the tar roads were filled with drunkard and dust and stuff, was all of sudden embarrassed and awkward by the witness; the event of ladies; using the public open space as toilet and to conceal this event of embarrassment, he turned abruptly, acting not noticed, with blank thought, not know how to distract, was in conversation on his mind, in seek of justice, with the government and stuff; intensed, flowed with the series of question and stuff; with the improvisation in the thought; pleasured; was all of sudden interrupted; by the bang on the table, by the tea master who dropped the newly poured tea glass, on table, where he moved his stare from the lower left leg to the table slab, picked, paned, sipped, and settled to present for some time, ecstasy, blissed, realised, dried, tilted, witnessed, heard, some random news from the television, that was blurting about some suicide case.

And at the back, there was a laugh, a pale man, aged 40, hair dyed, showcased two rows of frontal teeth, bright, laughed heavy, by the excitement of the event which involved in hatching of 35 crocodile eggs, that was tracked and protected for 90 days at the conservation and the thought of first time witnessing the crackage of the egg, where it emits the peak that consists of nostrils and gradually it reveals the eye and the whole head comes out of the white shell, then the front right and left leg; and the rear left and right one, to the mud now and was watching him, his dyed hair, from those little dark and yellowish eye, rotating, dwarf one and he, was in connection with them, the thirty plus dwarf crocodiles. With this excitement, it was interrupted by the cunningness that involved deception where for the three glass of tea, he paid two, and caught; embarrassed; not had clue what has happened; was in process to settle thing in right; paid the third tea amount; worried, internally justified and realised the cause of deception which was unintentional, and wondered it cause of occurrence, of its cunning nature, was half convinced that it is not of his plan to cheat; with the double mindedness to not to settle with two side, depressed, and moved, sat near the old man with the white and grey beard who was talking to himself with false conversation, for the justice, to build the public toilet; was ignored and tilted to the direction of television that was blurting about the forest fire that killed 90% of animals and other living being thither.
