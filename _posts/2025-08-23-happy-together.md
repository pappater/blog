Happy Together, 1997 
I knew it will have wong kar wai touch and he creates his world in agentenia, right opposite to hongkong, where the movie travels with two mates, trying reaching the water fall which hs the myth that stuff with jealous, split two lover, thus created the channel of water fall that stands world biggest one, and they carry a lamp, which resembles, kind of identify to the love they had, yet, in deep, somewhere, the instability, blocks, to be exists together. The start over, hit difference, that each time, it starts over again, and ends the same, and it didn’t last long. Fai who seek a stable, certain stuff, unfound it in his partner, and the on and off their stuff, and the movie goes like that, until the co worker, who personally, I like most, in relates to his character, and it gives kind of vibe, when the character, sometime reveals, ourself, and i felt when he was recording the voice, and the reasons are straight to the point, and his travel is to end of the work, standing at the lighthouse, to let the sorrows of the soul which he brought in his recorder, but it was a sobbing, uninterpreted and thus, anyway it was let out, and there, Fai reached his town’s people, and then wong kar wai shows the city landscape of his native, it feels good to be back to the hometown, and there he find the guy who was at the lighthouse parents place, by seeing those picture hangs in the mirror, and the same feels missing fai as well, and thus it goes like that. Coming to the technicality, I love black and white, and some of the shorts were still in my head. I was admiring those perspectives, leading lines, background and stuff. Some slow motion hits different, Wong's slow always hits with different meaning and stuff, and the way Fai misses his partner when he reaches the fall at the end, makes me sad. And the lamp too had a two souls, one wearing a red hat, and thus how important and connected it is to be with another soul and stuff, and yeah, the water fall was viewed in different angle, that those tiny bird that was indulged into the showers of the fragments from the fall, was something I’m jealous of not being there, to be one among them. Loneliness can’t be captured in any other way, like how Wong captured, as any one who had their loneliness can be closely attached to his movie, and this too holds the same. 96 minutes of pure cinema, that I miss being the bird again.  

And Marya’s blabbering. I was waiting for such a conversation, and happy to read it, when Shatov and the narrator of the Devil meet her, and the dream she mentioned is raw and I just wanted to write it and stuff.  

The morning was sunny, but it wasn’t hot to make people stay in their room, and there was a food truck filled with people, eating breakfast. I was there and ordered a plain dosa, and the poori was so fast that everyone got a bite of it, and mysore bonda, egg dosa and stuff. I hate mysore bonda. And normal bonda as well. Last week when I was returning home from ikea, I saw similar truck there, near the Nilofar cafe, and there they were boiling the Ulunthu bonda, and it happened to be mixed with Maitha again and I hate it for the fact for stopping there for a bite and it starts to drizzle, I paid and left as soon as possible, and I call her and was blabbering her, how I miss vadai in our home town. I miss nellai.   

Will the hero’s wife get jealous of seeing their husband with some other women ?   

And some don’t know the fact that it was illegal, that the celebration is something they earned to be celebrated, for the hard time they had gone through, and the fact is, people don’t know this fact, and are blamed for being themself, and label them being showcasing and stuff.   

FIP saved my day again.   

Her first taste of Guava.   

And what did they do ?  
Feeding a stray dog is now politicised.  
I fed him the bones, and I fed him forever.   
I was missing blues   
And the white cat,  
On roof, licking herself,   
The goat wailing echoed the street,   
That the next day the house is filled with people,   
And there ain’t no voices of goats on the nights.   
Some feed people, some feed dogs,  
Some hate both,  
Some put their parent in hunger,   
Some put themselves to hunger,   
Some over eat,   
Some less eat,   
Some waste,   
Some do it for taste,   
And those millipede gang is on the street,  
Getting sticky between the shoes and the tars,  
That it sadness when lives are no longer useful,   
Where are those birds ?   
When left to die in the legs of humans ?  
It is your sin, no being kept them as your prey,  
That you will be face the consequence,  
On the judgement day.  
It is for you al well, oh birds of earth,  
That queuing along with the other beings,  
And you face the consequence, oh birdy.   

And the guy in pink, order mutton,  
Left the table, uneaten.  
He got some cigarettes,   
Walk like a warrior,  
Hunger for the day begins now.  

I was making collage today. Cutting those pictures, grouping them together, sticking them, and doing stuff like that. It was my many day task to do, and it took a year to do it. I was doing the same digitally, and I had captured those in Part - 1, now this time it is more of physical stuff. And it hits differently when you feel its presence. And I got the urge to draw a few stuff, but didn't get time because I slept 3 hours in the evening. Before resuming the Happy together, I took a bath. I play the FIP in high volume. I like to hear songs while showering. I like to shower these days. Feeling each bit of it on the skin, and the warmth of it, and was a little cautious not to spray those fragments on the phone that i’ve taken inside. I trashed the useless papers and stuff and informed them that I will be leaving a suitcase here, and will be picking it up on October mid. I don't know what I'm gonna do next year. No idea, but enjoying it in a way that doesn't worry me. The room mate was watching thapathi, in telugu version. Maybe his legacy is being spread after Coolie. I like Coolie, not caring about others' opinions. I forgot things, and I was telling him about the Vizag trip, and he was saying I already told him those stories. This happens to me all the time. I repeat stuff to people. But I wonder why I don’t do it to her. Maybe she didn’t notice or she didn't want me to know that I repeat. We repeat stuff right ? Everything is a circle, so do the thoughts too. Nothing is put into the trash after being let out. It is still there, and comes when it wants to. It doesn’t have any constraint on repetition and stuff. And yeah, the coffee is good. I filled 100 ml and sipped it. Filled those two bottles, and ready for the night. I was given murukku, but left aside. The banana smell is too tempting, but I don’t get the appetite to eat them. Maybe I will watch another movie.
