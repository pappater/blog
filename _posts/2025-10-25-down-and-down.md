“i fall down and down, that no matter how hard i try, it pulls me down, and they said, it gains the energy as you are willing to get up, and doubles up the down, and you follow me, grab me, for a short distance, like a waterfall, and i flow like the river, in smile we swim like leaves, and at some point, someone has to realize, or nature decides what to do, and thus you stop there, and i flow, flow like a kaattaarru, that has no limits, in the direction, undecided, natural, and creates on its own, and someday, all of it mingles there, and you left me there in the middle, i still smile, falling further down, not knowing where i’m going, but it feels good, i felt nice as it pulls me down, it is the nature’s call, like how magnets have two forces, i repel, and hitting the bottom of the ocean, it is still, dark, and the noise is too haunting, i liked this atmosphere, i love this loneliness, the solitude takes me high, yes, it is still in the highness, as i go deeper and deeper, where am i going? who knows. why am i going, for that too, who knows, that it feels nicer to be following the nature’s path, and it slides there like anything, it feels like i’m caught between coral, maybe a gap between two rocks, who knows, nothing is visible, but i can feel that something is happening, i’m still there, not moving, high on the vibe, and yes, it tightens me hard, i feel the aloofness, a pleasure of getting down deeper inside, that the physicality has settled, but the inner self digs deep inside that it has no end to it, as the darkness grows, and you feel tight all over you, the feel, ecstatic, the abyss sucking you, you are becoming something, inner, that is a reflection on your outer self, and the opposite is happening, the energy of the south is turning into the north, you are in the middle, the pain is real, waiting silently, to let it pass, as that is what we can do, it is either this or that, and no one can see or be in sense during the transition from this to that, and yes, i was in silence, in an abyss, and as i was shaken, hard, and now it was grabbed by hands, but how, who knows, it may be god, everything happens, and there is no reason necessary, and yes, in the abyss, i was shaken, and grabbed by hands of dark, and his inner skin formed a layer when one kept his hands for a long time, and it feels soothing, and no one knows who told the hands to behave in such a way when you are in water for long, and as i was taken out, i see the sun over me, it is bright, and the breeze is heavy, it is towards the sunset, and as i was piled on the corner of his boat, i still feel the tightness of the rock, that is making me crazy, i wanted to be relieved as soon as possible, and i was in constant war against it, and this time, after a long struggle, i was split open, and the pearl was brought out, and put for sale. i miss my abyss.”
