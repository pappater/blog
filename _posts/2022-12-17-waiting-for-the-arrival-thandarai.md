â€œAndha light oru masam eriyala thambi'' said the old man, blurting out while walking and settling under the banyan tree. It was the public school name board light, he was referring to. Behind the school was an area filled with greenery and empty land and the series of rectangular cake stones installed, painted red, indicating the boundaries and separation of land, stands an old couple, along with cows, trees, mist and birds. The old mother was in constant swearing about anything that happens and it was the old deaf and dumb father, hears nothing but senses it was a swear from his wife, conceal his temper, but intermittently revealed and showcased it to the near by cows or tree or mist or birds. She is always in the past, as it holds the memories of her two sons, who migrated to town two years ago and was thinking how pleasant they were with their marriage and people and gathering and all of sudden, the face goes down thinking of that specific moment of jealousy which splits everything that was smooth. And with these thoughts running randomly, the old couple moved and passed the streets that were glowing bright with vilakku and stuff for the deepam festival. The centre junction was installed with the huge cylinder of hay and flammable material, in order to light them, for the rituals.

It was a left out under construction single room building, partially painted blue and with a rusted grill that separates the buyers and the sellers, and at the back, a large steel door was in open condition, adding up the stock of alcohol. It is like a mushroom shaped crowd that was gathered in front, and the immediate people are in an urge to get the liquor and the latter part was recently dropped off and in discussion with the night plan to be spent with fellas and the reason would be of deepam festival. The younger son, was taking one of his mate, in the back seat, was riding a bike, which is of old rusted, non maintained, bike of 2000s, and with the delayed response of brake, made them to halt hundred metre further than expected, balanced with the two legs, reversed, stopped, parked, enquired, finalised, brought, and settled to the left of the dark street, out of the village. His unmarried bravery made him do all sorts of crazy things and didn't care a little about what was happening out there surrounding him.

Parallel to this scene, the elder one, was in urge to get together, since the quarrel, and in the intention, enquired the same with the old couple, confirmed and promised his arrival, with the family and with his brother, to the old couple house, to have a family dinner there and to settle up things which is left out without concern two year ago. And the same news was shared to the old couple and the mother, who was always in past, for the first time, settled to the present, and the swear is gradually turned to haste as it was such a unexpected moment, that she thought of, and hurried home; to arrange things for the sons arrival of the night.

He, the younger, started to imagine his childhood memories, when his left canines were in an urge to drop off, and using his tongue, sensed it movement forward and backward and it was an unexpected moment that the space was empty and the canine dropped off. In search of it on the mud, found and buried and slept. It was the same sensation, he felt and used his tongue, sensed the canine, but this time, it was strong enough not to be dropped off, but was blurting out his disappointment to his fellow drunkards, inside the darkness with mist and birds and mosquitos, insects and flies.

And there the old couples were busy, preparing, getting stuff, for cooking and amusing the grandchild, and the house was lighted up with deepam and stuff and the mother too was lightened up and the swearing ceased. The deaf father acted as if he had become un-defected.

As the drunkard gang raised up and following the buzzing of flies, with the disappointment of canine undropped to the earth and mud, in urge, to closure the hardness and depression, bent, tilted his ankle, removed the sandals, with his right hand, raised above his head, and chasing the buzzing sound, and in quarrel with the flies. The instability took the unconscious gang to the highway and was danced and zig zagged hither and thither and in thought of finally hit, raise the sandals to the maximum, and with the force, slapped onto the bike that was passing, and both the team of drunkards by foot and drunkards by bike, rolled, went and settled inside the darkness of the deserted street, mingled with dust and stuff, unconscious and dozed off there, the gang of drunkards by foot and drunkard by bike. It was an elder son, among the drunkards by bike.

There, the villagers gathered around the hay and flammable stuff, and lit up, and danced and enjoyed and rolled and did crackers and it was blasting on to the dark sky and stuff. The old couple were missing at this celebration as they were waiting for their sons arrival for the celebration at home.
