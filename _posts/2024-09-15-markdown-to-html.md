# How to Convert Markdown to HTML: A Step-by-Step Guide

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using a plain-text editor. It’s simple, human-readable, and widely used in platforms like GitHub for writing README files and documentation. But what if you want to convert your Markdown files into HTML for use in websites or other projects?

In this article, we’ll walk you through various ways to convert Markdown (`.md`) files into HTML, covering tools ranging from online converters to command-line utilities. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced user, you’ll find something here that suits your needs.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a markup language with a simple syntax, designed for creating formatted text using plain-text editors. The beauty of Markdown is that it can easily be converted into different formats, such as HTML, PDF, and more. The focus here is converting Markdown to HTML, which is ideal for web development and publishing.

## Why Convert Markdown to HTML?

HTML is the core language of the web, and if you’re building websites, you’ll often need your content in HTML format. Converting Markdown to HTML allows you to:

- Render your Markdown content directly on web pages.
- Customize the appearance of Markdown files via CSS.
- Embed the content in blogs, personal websites, or documentation sites.

Now, let’s explore the various methods and tools for converting Markdown to HTML.

## Tools for Converting Markdown to HTML

### 1. **Online Markdown to HTML Converters**

#### Dillinger

[Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) is a popular online Markdown editor that offers real-time Markdown-to-HTML conversion. It’s ideal if you’re looking for a quick, web-based solution without installing any software.

#### How to Use Dillinger:

1. Open [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/).
2. Either write your Markdown content directly in the editor or upload your existing `.md` file.
3. As you type or upload the file, the HTML version will appear in the preview pane.
4. You can export your content as an HTML file by clicking the export button and selecting **HTML**.

#### Markdown Live Preview

[Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/) is another lightweight web-based Markdown editor. It’s perfect for a fast conversion without the bells and whistles of more complex tools.

#### How to Use Markdown Live Preview:

1. Visit [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).
2. Paste or write your Markdown content on the left side.
3. The converted HTML will appear on the right-hand side.
4. You can copy the generated HTML and use it in your project.

### 2. **Command-Line Tools**

If you’re comfortable working with the terminal, several command-line tools allow you to convert Markdown to HTML efficiently.

#### Pandoc

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is one of the most powerful tools for document conversions. It supports many formats, including Markdown to HTML. It's highly customizable, making it a favorite among developers.

##### Installing Pandoc:

- **macOS**: Use Homebrew to install Pandoc:
  ```bash
  brew install pandoc
  ```
- **Linux**: Install Pandoc using your package manager (e.g., `apt` for Ubuntu):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install pandoc
  ```
- **Windows**: Download and install Pandoc from the [official site](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

##### Using Pandoc to Convert Markdown to HTML:

Once Pandoc is installed, you can convert your Markdown file to HTML using the following command:

```bash
pandoc README.md -f markdown -t html -s -o README.html
```

- `README.md` is your Markdown file.
- `-f markdown` specifies the input format (Markdown).
- `-t html` specifies the output format (HTML).
- `-s` makes sure the output is standalone (contains complete HTML structure like `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- `-o` specifies the output file, in this case, `README.html`.

You’ll now have an `HTML` file that you can embed in any webpage.

#### markdown-cli

Another simple and efficient command-line tool is [markdown-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-cli). It’s lightweight and perfect for quick conversions, especially if you’re using Node.js.

##### Installing markdown-cli:

You can install markdown-cli globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g markdown-cli
```

##### Converting Markdown to HTML with markdown-cli:

To convert a Markdown file to HTML, run:

```bash
markdown README.md > README.html
```

- `README.md` is the Markdown file you want to convert.
- The `>` operator redirects the output to a new `README.html` file.

This tool is fast and simple, making it a great choice for quick local conversions.

### 3. **Text Editors with Export Options**

If you prefer working in a GUI, there are text editors that allow you to convert Markdown to HTML directly from the editor. These are great for users who want a visual interface.

#### Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular code editor that supports Markdown out of the box. With extensions, you can easily export your Markdown files as HTML.

##### Steps to Convert Markdown to HTML in VS Code:

1. Open your Markdown file (`README.md`) in VS Code.
2. Install the extension **Markdown Preview Enhanced** by running the command `ext install shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced`.
