Hyderabad, a city known for its rich heritage and layered cultural identity, revealed another face of itself yesterday. As I walked through the lanes near Charminar, I found myself amid a large gathering—quiet at times, intense at others, and altogether unlike anything I had witnessed before. A procession was making its way through the streets, and what I saw wasn’t just a religious ritual, but a living expression of sorrow, memory, and resilience.

Men dressed in black shirts formed silent lines. Some stood in quiet reflection, while others engaged in a striking and painful-looking ritual. Shirtless and unwavering, they rhythmically beat their backs with chains embedded with blades. Blood marked their skin, but not their resolve. It wasn’t violence—it was a form of mourning, called Zanjeer Zani, performed to honor the suffering of Imam Hussain, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad. As the procession moved, decorated horses and camels passed by, followed by something even more surprising—a majestic elephant, adorned and walking steadily, like part of a royal past resurrected for a moment in time.

This entire observance is rooted in the story of Karbala, a tragic yet heroic chapter in Islamic history. Over 1,400 years ago, Imam Hussain stood against Yazid, a ruler many believed represented corruption and tyranny. Rather than give in, Hussain chose resistance—knowing the cost. He, along with his family and a small group of supporters, was surrounded in the desert of Karbala, denied water, and ultimately killed. His stand wasn’t for power, but for principle. His sacrifice became a symbol of moral courage and resistance that still echoes today.

The horses in the procession represent Zuljanah, the loyal steed that returned riderless after Imam Hussain's death. Camels symbolize the caravan that carried the surviving women and children, taken prisoner and marched across lands. These elements aren’t mere tradition—they are visual metaphors, carrying the weight of centuries.

Hyderabad, in particular, carries this memory with intensity. The city was ruled for centuries by Muslim dynasties like the Qutb Shahis and the Nizams, who followed Shia Islam and established deep traditions of Muharram observance. In Charminar, these commemorations aren’t just religious—they’re cultural. The area transforms. Taziyas are carried through the streets, imambaras are lit with reverence, and processions pass through lanes where ancient history and modern life blend seamlessly.

What stood out, even more than the rituals, was the unity in diversity. Among the crowds were people from different faiths, different sects, and different walks of life. Some offered water. Others simply stood in quiet respect. There was no fear, no division—only recognition of a shared space and shared emotion. This is something Hyderabad shares with cities like Lucknow, where Shia and Sunni communities have long coexisted, not just tolerating each other but often participating in each other’s traditions.

As I left the area, the sound of the chains—the mournful rhythm of remembrance—lingered in my ears. It didn’t feel like pain. It felt like memory refusing to be forgotten. A voice from the past insisting that some sacrifices must always be remembered. And one message stood out above all: stand for what is right, even if you must stand alone.
