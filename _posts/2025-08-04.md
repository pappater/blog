It is abstract—nothing was clear enough to make a decision. It is rare to lead and reach the place it was expected to. The man who used to be jovial was tense this time and was getting on the nerves of those two boys. As they weren’t able to cover anything, the severity increased, adding tension to the event. Something was expected to be done for the day, and if not, nothing much was bothered about. And if anything is left open, it needs justification—otherwise, you are the one to blame. It should be noted that providing status is an art, and while some do it casually, for me, it’s a major task of the day. I consider it a significant part of my work. They want a solution to work toward the goal, and it should be guided in such a way that, at the exact timeline, the expectation should at least match—otherwise, it’s considered a fault. And it’s not left as it is; it must be tagged to someone. It’s a game of tagging—either a fault or something marvelous, but nothing should be left open. Who is unfit for this job? Obviously, anti-social people. Can they rise to the level this job requires? That’s debatable and depends on the role. The thing is, it’s agile everywhere—parallelism. One should have a mindset to do all kinds of jobs. It’s not organized work; it looks like it, but at its core, it’s agile. As per my understanding, anything can be altered at any time—the requirement, the solution, the test cases, the business rules. We can even discard the development if it’s deemed a useless solution. In this frame, it’s hard to balance perfectionism, which isn’t needed individually but is considered important as a whole to provide a clear picture and end goal. In agile, it’s not so—everything is bits and pieces, and as we go with the flow, the blurs slowly clear, and we begin to identify what’s really happening in our day-to-day tasks. I wouldn’t say agile is a failure—it’s actually a good approach, provided we are clear about what we’re doing. If we meet the threshold, it works well, as either this or that can fix things, and this can be felt, identified, decided, and moved forward. And the learning curve? It’s there in the beginning, but once the flow is established, the groovy work keeps its rhythm and can be synchronized among people. What happened to those two folks? What were they blamed for—unproductiveness? This is a common disease in this work culture. Somehow, the root cause can be identified. As I see it, the availability of opportunities is high, or one can create their own. Every individual is in sync with some secondary work in their mind, or some may already be doing it, which leads to lethargy, laziness, and a lack of seriousness. One day, it shows its real face, and to be honest, many people are humiliated in this field. No matter who you are, you’re humiliated in such a way that you feel it for days, come back stronger, taste the fruits of it, and then forget.
