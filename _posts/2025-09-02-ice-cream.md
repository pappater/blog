He was wearing a checked yellow half shirt, three unbuttoned at the front, the chest reveals his grey hair, and the red lip corner the betel juice, and peddle his bicycle which is of the the brand hero, an old one, rusted green and white mud guard, was rushing to the village, and slows down, as he witnessed the series of houses, found no soul, and somewhere, the matinee drama, was echoing the wailing of the treacherous villainess, that he stops it, tilted and placed the wooden box, of peeled paints, in his shoulder, and with his left hand biceps panned to his forehead, and swept of his sweat, and spitted the red beetle stuff at the corner carefully, and with his right hand, he took the funnel that end is placed with the strong green rubber button, and he pressed in and release gentle, that it echoed against the wailing from the television as poooopeeeeeee. And the disturbed beetles, conquering the mud road, and marching towards this man, and it signalled him to motion a little, to tempt the upcomings, and halted again, when the bunch gathers, and it is just the job of the man to grab the money from the hand, and hear the order, and provide his service, and they gone when this ceremony is completed. And there is one hand, trying hard to get attention, and repeating his desire, and he did able to get the ice cream of his flavour, and with the excitement, for the buy, from scolding, and cunnings and planning and admiring and fighting and cheating and behaviouring and misbehaviouring, dreaming and stuff, and with that all in one emotion, he grapes the stick of the ice cream, of mango flavour, and in the dream of taking his tongue, and lick on the top layer of the juice that started to melt at the noon hours, yet with the jerk, it fall on the mud, rolled, and fragment like a glass, and coated with those tiny little stones called sand.
