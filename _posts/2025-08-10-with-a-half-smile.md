It was open ended after buying a Coke,  
the cap in his header, two of his teeth are missing.  
The girl is smiling over the joke, and still laughs even after it gets over.  
Cat waiting for the prey,  
The snake waiting for the rat,  
The soul waiting for the give back.  
And to witness the fading face. It is pleasant, satisfactory.  
Heard, fools are one who satisfy,  
And I say, you fool.  
Pictures of old grama, knitting for her granddaughter.  
Cheaters cheat, and not feeling the guilt, sleep that night.  
And why am I regretting stuff ?  
His leg is swollen, and enquired, and signalled, and cleaned the floor.  
He forced her to sit in the first seat, she half smiled.  
Sudden jerk and the normal life resumes anyway.  
I know there was a post box.  
And people got sick of waiting, and seeking something else, regretting.  
What a waste.  
I fear it might rain today.  
I see the rain clouds.  
I see the message filled with warning.  
Testing the car, A Car, Car.  
It moved, with a half smile.
