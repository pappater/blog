Overall, the landing page, blog, and documentation page have been set up, with the portfolio page still in progress. For the past few years, I’ve been using Tumblr for blogging and content sharing. I’ve always preferred writing raw thoughts over concise posts. However, as a web developer, I now spend much of my time on GitHub and related tools.

During my college days, I experimented with GitHub Pages and Jekyll, but there wasn’t much demand for it back then. Recently, I’ve been surfing the web more than I used to and have delved into English literature, which caused me to neglect technical documentation. As I gradually returned to reading official documentation, I became concerned about missing important and thought-provoking points I had previously noted in a notebook—now becoming unwieldy.

Seeking a digital solution, I began experimenting with Markdown files. I organized technical topics into separate folders, documenting each concept in `.md` files. When pushed to GitHub Pages, this rendered as a static website, which was fantastic. This rekindled my interest in Jekyll, leading me to create a landing page that currently features information about the documentation and blog.

I built the landing page using Create React App (CRA) for simplicity, following a guide on deploying a React app to `pappater.github.io`. The setup worked seamlessly within minutes. Now, everything—blogging, documentation, and the landing page—is managed locally. A simple push to the remote repository handles deployment automatically.

As I visit GitHub daily, it motivates me to update the blog and documentation regularly. In 2044, I named my Jekyll site “Cut Copy Paste” and today, I’ve been refining it by copying and pasting content to make it work seamlessly. It’s exactly what I need at the moment.
