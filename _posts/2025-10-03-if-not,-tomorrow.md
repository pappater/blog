They’re gonna get my job. It was more efficient than me, but it is spiritually sick. Is it only the bot that is sick in spirit? No, I would say. It is with the people, who have painted their faces with arrogance, who have none of the spirit, and are useless to anyone. At least a bot is useful in some way, as an agent. 

However, yesterday’s event was more chaotic than it seemed. The faces of those people made me sick. I was speaking up for the old man, won’t they be human? I spoke for them. I was angry at the arrogance. And then she came, with the slit. She threw some rupees at their faces, yet they didn’t react. They had lost their spirit. They would do anything for a rupee.  
Mother India has lost her souls, because she holds such soulless humans and made them live. Whether she will or not, a mother is a mother to even a murderer. Can’t they realize the fact that in the end, it is nothing? So why such arrogance? Can’t they see it? Can’t they see the mother’s suffering, her crying, her tears?  

I felt it. I took the suffering of millions, and it is Mother India who holds the vexes. There exists a vex, and we simply transfer it to someone else, and the chain continues until the mother holds them all, overflows, and bursts in tears. What filthy beings we are.  

And that was all that was spoken, the satisfaction of throwing the money on his face. Respect is just a word, and it means nothing to people here. I was only seeing a bot in human form, but a useless one.  

I was using Microsoft Copilot’s agent feature, generating a random domain name by providing a basic prompt. It did it in 15 minutes, raised the MR, provided a notification to review and merge, and got it deployed on GitHub Pages. I felt my job was gone, for good. Later, at 3 in the morning, stunned by its capacity, I was editing on top of it, and it delivered a good app. But I hated it, not a single line of code was mine, and I didn’t care. It has become a form of creating art without knowing the process, just the output alone.  
Personally, I’m liking the script way of coding more than the web. Building a web is such a big task nowadays. Scripts feel like writing a blog.  

A few days back, we were checking some Terraform code where a 100 MB file had been committed locally. The push failed due to the error — file size limit is 100 MB. Reverting the changes locally was hectic. I planned to explore a solution, and I found that there exists a pre-commit hook, where we can restrict such commits. Once the hook passes, the commit happens. There exist countless rules and conditions for these. I was glad to know all this.  

I lost the movie strike, though. Will start today, if not, tomorrow.  

I can feel the scam all over the event. The meat was ready for the taxpayers. Food was basic, but not proper. The fight between the gangs continues indirectly. No one talks. For it is just a street and a half, the village capacity. No one talks. Or maybe they do, but only when there is one. And he lived there alone, when the whole village vacated. It was he who stayed, and died. The lone wolf.
